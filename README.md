Task 2: Image Encryption & Decryption using Pixel Manipulation

ðŸ”¹ Objective:
Build a tool that can encrypt and decrypt images by manipulating pixel values, ensuring that the original image can be reconstructed with the correctÂ decryptionÂ key.

Develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation techniques.

The tool should allow users to both encrypt and decrypt images.

You may implement pixel-level operations such as:

Swapping pixel values

Shuffling pixel positions

Applying mathematical operations (e.g., XOR, addition, subtraction)Â toÂ pixelÂ values
